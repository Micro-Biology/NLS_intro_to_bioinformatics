# Python

Python is another programming language. In some regards it is much easier than BASH.
For us Python is less about one-liners that will show you basic information (BASH), and more about analysing or manipulating data.

Remember to first enter your python conda environment using:

    conda activate py37

## The Basics:

For simplicities sake, the first 6 chapters of Automate The Boring Stuff will cover basic python terminology, it may seem a bit abstract from biology for now but it forms the fundamentals of what we need to do.
